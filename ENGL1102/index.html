                    In my paper, I introduced the concept of operating system and it's role in a computing environment. In order to get a glance at its powerful use, I had to watch closely some people living next to me using their computers and ask them how they felt about using an operating system. I deepen the conversation with them by asking specific questions especially about how easy it is to use an operating system whether it is windows, Linux or MacOs and what is the most common use they make of it. Researching about this topic is very important especially in the field of computer science, or for the general public where almost every one is using a type of computing device. By gathering opinion about operating system, it can help developers and company improve the architecture of the system they intend to sell. It is equally important for me as well, as a computer science student. After carefully observed a few people using their computer with an operating system, I conclude that indeed OS is a powerful tool in any computing system and users sometime are using it without knowing it's true potential.

                    Not to say everyone, but almost everyone nowadays is using a form of computing device. This device might be a smartphone, a laptop, a desktop computer, a mainframe, or even a workstation. When we think about all the possible things just at our fingers tip or using a keyboard and a mouse, it sounds wonderful right?  Now let's take some time to wonder, how is this possible? We don't know the intern design of the computer, and even so how does the communication happen between us and the hardware? All of these things that seem very easy for us to do with a computer have been carefully programmed to satisfy our needs in automating task or communicating. For a better experience and management, that's where the operating system comes in. Operating system is very important in computing device. Some defines it as the manager of the computer, and they are right. The operating system controls everything happening under the hood of any computing system <cite>Arpaci-Dusseau (2018)</cite>. Its roles are very interesting and complex; among them we can highlight resources management mentioned <cite>Aparci-Dusseau (2018)</cite>, it provides as well a graphical user interface to make interaction easier <cite>(Computer Hope, 2021)</cite>, and it is worth mentioning that at the heart of the OS lies the kernel which provides us access to it via a command line interface or shell <cite>(Cornell University, 2019)</cite>.

                    Any computing device no matter how small, contains many different parts which we identify as a resource, and the operating system has the job of managing all of these resources. <cite>Aparci-Dusseau</cite> wrote: <q>the OS is sometimes known as a resource manager. Each of the CPU, memory, and disk is a resource od the system, …</q> <cite>(2018, chapter 2 p. 2)</cite>. The CPU fetches instructions and executes them whenever a user launches a program or initiate a process. As end user, we doesn't care about how deleting a file works, how writing to the disk works, how multitasking works. The OS takes care of all that for us, and we just take a leap of faith hoping that everything will go as intended.

                    For the user to be able to work with the device and have an optimal experience, the operating system provides a graphical user interface. The GUI is an interactive system that use interactive components to display information to a computer user <cite>(Computer Hope, 2021)</cite>. It contains a lot features that makes the use of a computer very easy for everyday user, such as: buttons, scroll bar, menu, option bar etc. This allow the user to navigate very quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For more experienced user the OS provides an interface to communicate with it directly, which is a command line interface. Cornell University published that the CLI can have different names based on the OS, terminal on Linux or MacOS, PowerShell on Windows <cite>(2018)</cite>. No matter the name, the CLI allows you to automate process and communicate with the OS using a text based environment. Copying file, deleting file, read and write files, managing permission, accessing disk etc are possible with the command line and faster to perform. However, it proves to be a difficult tool to use for user with no prior programming knowledge.

                <p>
                    After carefully reviewing all this, I decided, for the study, to go with the quantitative method so I can observe more on the subject. My objective was to observe my usage of operating and as well my girlfriend's usage. Moreover, I contact some of my siblings to get their point of view about operating system. I could have extended the observation to a bigger audience for a wider point of view. However, working and learning from home does not give me too much option. Now let's take a look of how the study went.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my thesis I mentioned that operating system is very important in any computing environment, and I extended with different points that make an operating system special and important. During the study, I have carefully monitored how I use my computer and my phone to make sure I completely understand and appreciate the power of an operating system. First I have to point that I am using two different operating system apart Android that comes with my phone, Windows 10 — one the most used OS in the market, especially for beginner—, and Ubuntu —one of the best Linux distro—.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To illustrate the fact that the operating system is a resource manager, I decided to make an experience of my own, so we will see that in action. I brought a Dell OptiPlex desktop with one 8Gb RAM DDR3. There were three other slots for RAM, I put three other DDR3 of 4 Gb to have the computer running at 20gb but when I tried to power up the computer it wouldn't power up. I clicked the button again and again, it gave the appearance of being powering up but then suddenly shut down. I removed two of the ram and left the computer with 12Gb and the computer powered up. The point is, the operating system checks that the hardware needed for the computer to function are in perfect harmony. This experience made me realize how important an operating system can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the other part of the study, I watched how some people were using their laptop or computer and how they feel about the operating system they were using. I am beginning with my girlfriend, she had a Lenovo Ideapad 5 with Windows 10 and we upgraded to 11. The laptop was becoming slower as time goes. I asked her how is she doing with the laptop, is it easy to use? The laptop is easy to use she mentioned, as there are various icons, shortcuts, menu, option bar for her to interact with. She doesn't know too much about operating system, but she was aware that she was using one. I explained to her that what she mentioned that makes the computer so easy to use is a Graphical User Interface. Then she understood that the laptop would not make sense or would not be easy to interact with without the GUI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, I spoke with my siblings about how they use their computer and how is their experience so far. I got the same answer from them, that they are learning how to use it step by step and it is becoming easier thanks to the images, icons that are presented on the screen. The GUI is a powerful tool of the operating system, so there again the operating system is very important.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The study resulted to be very important especially for my field. I previously said that I would carefully monitor my usage of my computer and inquire about my related people's usage. I found that there are using the operating without fully understand its power, and all of the possibility of using an OS. However, they agree that the features included in their computing device are awesome, and without them they would not be able to use their device as they would not know how to allocate memory or free memory. They would not know how to initiate a network connection. Moreover, without the OS the device would not have a nice interface that facilitates the interaction. Personally, I interact with OS everyday and I am enjoying working with the terminal day by day. The terminal gives me more control over what can be performed on the computer. The study did not cover a great audience, but I still managed to learn and teach a few things along the way. I am thinking that a feature study could cover more ground and more topics related to operating system.
